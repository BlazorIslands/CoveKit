# CoveKit

## Philosophy

CoveKit is an opnionated Blazor component library that aims to follow a  neobrutalist philosophy in its visual style, in the way codebase is developed, and in the way developers use it in their own projects.

- We keep things simple with one style, neobrutalist.
- Make components that are immediately recognizable for what they are.  A button is a button, a text input is a text input, etc.
- If the usage of a component is unclear, then the component is not useful.
